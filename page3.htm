    sometimes we watched movies tgh i rmb we listened to playboi carti new album tgh.<br>
    We talked a lot, texted a lot, laughed a lot.<br>
    but things are kinda different now.<br>
    we still talk but not like before.<br>
    and i miss that and i miss u.<br>
    i miss the time we were in people's park.<br>
